                <h2>The Angraecum Magdalenae</h2>
                <p> This Madagascan orchid is lithophytic, meaning that it grows on rocks. It is found
                near quartzite
                boulders in leaf litter at elevations between 800-2000m.
                The Angraecum magdalenae has large, fleshy white flowers with a spicy, jasmine scent that intensifies at
                night. The flowers, which can last for 4–6 weeks, are 3–4" across and grow on short
                inflorescences that are .8–1.2" long and bear 1–5 flowers.
                There is some mystery surrounding the discovery of this orchid. While it is listed as being discovered
                by the French naturalist H. Perrier, he indicated that it should be called Madelaine's Angraecum in
                honour of Madelaine Drouhard, who found and cultivated it. Two years later, Perrier and Drouhard
                were married. It is unclear whether the two worked as a team or whether Perrier took credit for
                Drouhard's discovery. </p>

            <h2>The Lycaste Virginalis</h2>
            <p> The Lycaste virginalis is a large, epiphytic orchid. Epiphytic means that it grows
                on other plants – in this case in the forks of trees in cool cloud forests at elevations of 3950–6600ft
                (1200–2000m). Its range extends from Mexico (Chiapas) to Honduras.
                The Lycaste virginalis has fragrant, long-lasting, waxy flowers that are typically 4–6" across, though
                they can be as small as 2" and as large as 7". It blooms year round, with peak flowering in February
                and March in the northern hemisphere. The flowers grow singly on inflorescences (flower stalks) that
                are 6–12" long.
                The Lycaste virginalis is also known as the Monja Blanca or White Nun Orchid – Saq Hix in the Mayan
                language – and is the national flower of Guatemala.
                When the Lycaste virginalis was first introduced to European orchid enthusiasts in the late 1800s, it
                became highly sought after, leading to thousands of plants being taken from their native habitat in
                Guatemala. Most of these plants died. By the 1930s, the orchid was considered rare. A ban on the
                collection of L. virginalis was introduced in the 1940s, but poaching continued, which led to the
                Guatemalan government banning the export of all orchids until the 1990s. Protection efforts are ongoing,
                but the beautiful Lycaste virginalis remains endangered.
                The Lycaste virginalis is pollinated by Euglossa bees, which are attracted to the flower's fragrance.
                The plant itself is 12–20" tall and wide and has deciduous foliage. </p>

            <h2>The Phragmipedium X Richteri 'Wolf River'</h2>
            <p> This is a cultivated orchid, meaning that it is a hybrid that does not occur
                naturally and is propagated in gardens or nurseries. Its range is therefore given as simply
                "cultivated".
                Phragmipedium × richteri 'Wolf River' is a terrestrial orchid, which means that it grows in the ground,
                as opposed to epiphytic orchids, which grow on other plants for support.
                The sources state that a specimen of the Phragmipedium × richteri 'Wolf River' is on display in the
                Kogod Courtyard of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery.
                It is a member of the Phragmipedium genus, which belongs to the Cypripedioideae subfamily of orchids.
                Orchids in this subfamily are commonly known as lady's slipper orchids, thanks to their distinctive
                pouch-shaped labellum, which resembles a slipper. They are found in the Americas and Asia. </p>

            <h2>The Vanda Coerulea</h2>
            <p> The Vanda coerulea is a medium to large epiphytic orchid, meaning that it grows on other plants for support rather than in the ground. It is found growing on exposed dwarf oak trees in forests with a dry season at elevations between 2625–5600ft (800–1700m). Its range extends from Arunachal Pradesh in northeast India to southern Yunnan in China and through Indo-China.
                The Vanda coerulea produces long-lasting, fragrant, white flowers that are covered in a blue crosshatch pattern and are 4" in diameter. The flowers grow on erect or suberect inflorescences (flower stalks) that can grow up to 2 feet (0.6 metres) long and bear few to several flowers. It blooms from August to December in the northern hemisphere, with peak flowering in November.
                The Vanda coerulea is also known as The Blue Vanda. When it was first introduced to Europe in 1847, its large blue flowers caused a sensation, leading to many expeditions to collect the orchid, which put its survival in peril.
                The Vanda coerulea has a history of medicinal use in India, where the flowers have been used to treat chest conditions. The juice from the leaves has been used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery and skin conditions. Research into its medicinal properties is ongoing.
                The source states that the specimen of the Vanda coerulea in the Smithsonian Gardens Orchid Collection is from a cultivated plant and its wild origin is unknown.
                The plant itself is 20–75" tall and 18–30" wide, excluding the inflorescence.  </p>
